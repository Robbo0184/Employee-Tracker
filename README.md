# Employee-Tracker
Basic employee tracker with data persistence. 


Hi 

I have had a lot of fun working on this basic employee tracker. I have had no experience running express apps on Windows so unfortunately I can't say for certain that the following guidelines work. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have issues or further questions.

1. Clone the repo. 
2. Once the repo has been cloned

cd your-destination-folder
npm install # installing the dependencies
npm start # or 'node .'

I hope this works and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Kind regards
Rob
